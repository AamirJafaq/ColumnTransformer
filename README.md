# KNN
The ColumnTransformer in scikit-learn is a tool that allows you to apply different preprocessing or transformation pipelines to different columns of a dataset. This is especially useful when you have a dataset with mixed types of features (e.g., numerical and categorical) that require different preprocessing steps.\
By using ColumnTransformer, you can efficiently preprocess multiple columns simultaneously, handling each type of feature appropriately, without needing to process them separately.
